          <h3>Here’s how it works…</h3>
          <p style={style.paraHead}>
            <b>1). 3X your investment over 10 years</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            You get to purchase UK property with an average 47% discount against
            the RICS valuation price. This up-front genuine discount combined
            with a modest 4% annual price growth projection means each £100K
            invested turns into circa £300k over 10 years i.e. 3X in 10 years.
          </p>

          <p style={style.paraHead}>
            <b>2). Matching investors and tenants together</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            The strategy matches long-term investors with long-term elderly
            tenants, aged 72 on average:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The investor pays on average 53% of the property price.</li>
            <li>The tenant pays the other 47% in the form of advance rent.</li>
            <li>
              The investor is the registered owner with the Land Registry.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p style={style.paraHead}>
            <b>3). Key Benefits:</b>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Pre-packaged property and tenant supplied together.</li>
            <li>The tenant pays on average 12 years rent in advance.</li>
            <li>
              NO rental voids, NO late payments, NO bad debts, NO evictions​.
            </li>
            <li>NO letting agency fees.</li>
            <li>NO stamp duty, NO income tax​.</li>
            <li>NO building work, NO refurbishment costs.</li>
            <li>NO decorating, curtain, carpet or furniture costs​.</li>
            <li>NO maintenance and repair costs.</li>
            <li>NO insurance or safety inspection costs​.</li>
          </ul>

          <p style={style.paraHead}>
            <b>4). How do the numbers work?</b>
          </p>
          <p>Illustrative property deal:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>£200,000 property.​</li>
            <li>Investor pays £106,000 (47% discount).</li>
            <li>
              Property value after 10 years = £296,049 (based on a modest 4%
              annual price growth).​
            </li>
            <li>Profit = £190,049 = 180% ROI = 18% annualised.</li>
          </ul>

          <p style={style.paraHead}>
            <b>5). How much do the investments cost?</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Investment prices range from as little as £50,000 up to £250,000
          </p>

          <p style={style.paraHead}>
            <b>6). Where are the Properties?</b>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Most are in the south east and on the south coast of the UK.
            </li>
            <li>
              There is strong demand for property in these areas and solid
              economic fundamentals which support positive price growth.
            </li>
            <li>
              These areas have seen an average 8% annual price growth over the
              last 10 years.
            </li>
            <li>Our projections are based on a modest 4% growth.</li>
          </ul>

          <p style={style.paraHead}>
            <b>7). What happens at the end of the tenancy?</b>
          </p>
          <p>The average tenancy lasts 10 years, after which the owner can:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Sell the property.</li>
            <li>Rent it out.</li>
            <li>Move into it.</li>
            <li>Gift the property as part of IHT planning.</li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <p>
            N.B. investments can be re-sold before the end of the tenancy
            period.
          </p>

          <p style={style.paraHead}>
            <b>8). How much effort is required from the investor?</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Long-Term-Tenant is a fully managed ‘armchair’ investment with
            literally nothing for the investor to do other than enjoy the
            impressive returns
          </p>
          <p style={style.paraHead}>
            <b>9). Who is purchasing these investments?</b>
          </p>
          <p>Savvy investors who want…</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A better return on their cash in the bank.</li>
            <li>A safer asset class than the financial markets.</li>
            <li>To build wealth in UK property.</li>
            <li>To self-invest their pensions.</li>
            <li>
              To purchase property investments for their children and
              grandchildren.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p style={style.paraHead}>
            <b>10). Why have I not heard of this strategy before?</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            The strategy has been operating for over 40 years and thousand's of
            property investments have been successfully purchased this way.
            Since Section 24 tax changes the strategy has become a lot more
            appealing and is now being promoted as a retail investment
            opportunity. Prior to this, these investments were only offered to
            the banks and financial institutions who bought them for their own
            balance sheets.
